# Selftalker

Taken from https://github.com/shmlkv/selftalker and updated it with better switching keys and always dark mode.

Talk to yourself.

Use left-shift and right-shift to switch between yourself and your other self.

Access the same or bookmark at https://selftalker.github.io/ and https://nitincodery.github.io/selftalker/

Enjoy.
